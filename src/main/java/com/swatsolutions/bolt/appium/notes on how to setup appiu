1. Setup Driver to read a flag to know to start a selenium webdriver or an appiumdriver object.
2. Put the base of code for appium in its own section.
3. Figure out how to make steps use either appium or webdriver based on the test. Maybe use a flag and an if/else for every step.
4. Allow a step to do nothing for mobile or web as sometimes that may be required. (the if or else is left empty on a step)
5. May need a new package to hold all of the steps.
6. Add appium to the pom file:
        <dependency>
			<groupId>io.appium</groupId>
			<artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
			<version>5.0.4</version>
		</dependency>
7. Ensure similar functionality options between webdriver and appium

TODO
Check on issues with supporting different android/ios versions
Check if this is a viable option or if there is something else that could work
